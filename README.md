| **module05** | 13.5h | Exception Handling | Creating custom exceptions, try-catch blocks, and exception safety principles |
| **module06** | 8.5h | C++ Casting | Type conversion and casting operators (static_cast, dynamic_cast, reinterpret_cast, const_cast) |
| **module07** | 7h | Templates | Function templates, class templates, and template specialization for generic programming |

## Learning Progression

This curriculum follows a carefully designed progression:

### Foundations (Modules 00-01)
- **Module 00**: Introduces C++ syntax, basic I/O operations, and the concept of classes through simple programs like a phonebook application.
- **Module 01**: Explores memory management fundamentals, teaching the critical differences between stack and heap allocation, and introduces references as a safer alternative to pointers.

### Object-Oriented Programming Core (Modules 02-04)
- **Module 02**: Dives into operator overloading through the implementation of a fixed-point number class, demonstrating how to create custom data types that behave like built-in types.
- **Module 03**: Introduces inheritance with a game-inspired ClapTrap hierarchy, teaching how to extend and modify class behavior through inheritance.
- **Module 04**: Explores polymorphism and virtual functions through an Animal hierarchy, introducing abstract base classes and the power of runtime polymorphism.

### Advanced C++ Features (Modules 05-06)
- **Module 05**: Focuses on exception handling, teaching how to create robust programs that can gracefully handle error conditions through custom exception classes.
- **Module 06**: Covers C++ casting operators, providing the tools needed for safe and explicit type conversions in complex programs.

### Generic Programming & STL (Modules 07-09)
- **Module 07**: Introduces templates for generic programming, allowing code reuse across different data types without sacrificing type safety.
- **Module 08**: Explores STL containers and algorithms, teaching how to leverage the powerful Standard Template Library for efficient data manipulation.
- **Module 09**: Culminates in a complex project involving file processing and advanced STL usage, demonstrating how to build real-world applications with proper data structures and algorithms.
